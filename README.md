# Java-Galaga
An attempt at recreating the 1981 game Galaga in Java. Also my final project for CIS 120.

Current Features:
- You can fire at successive waves of enemies
- Can gain a high score (it won't be saved, however)

Known Bugs To Fix:
- Movement is weirdly choppy
- For some reason, when firing two missiles, once the first missile hits an enemy, both get destroyed
- Probably many more

Features To Add:
- Enemies need to attack
- Dynamic backgrounds similar to the 1981 original
- Scoring system that utilizes high score
- Enemy movement that is more like the 1981 original
- Better graphics and sound

Other things
- This entire thing needs refactoring
